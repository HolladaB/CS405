# CS405

This contains the coursework from CS405/ secure coding. The goal of the course was to create a security policy guide for Green Pace. This guide would help provide recommendations for how to implement a policy and maintain it. Within the document, security principles were analyzed to emphasize their importance. From that 10 potential coding standards within the guide were determined to show the importance of following and applying them. Each of these standards was giving a risk assessment to help determine which should have priority. Within this guide, the importance and Defense-in-Depth was shown. Tools were suggested for automation and to add overlapping layers of security. Looking through the document will show the topics that I learned through the course and how I was able to apply them. A presentation on this was also created to showcase the main points of the document while providing a cohesive guide to the policy.
